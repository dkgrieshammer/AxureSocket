# Axure Socket Server


This is a mere Experiemnt for now but will be developed for broader use;
Its an electron app that serves a local socket server to link Axure (and other) Prototypes for realtime application prototyping, linking of views and remote triggering of events.

You need the axure elements (made some examples in an AxureLib attached in the Folder)

If you want to run from code:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Also packed electron apps for mac and windows
